# Eco_friendly_Vehicle_Detection_using_yolo_v5

The increase in carbon emissions from vehicles has raised serious environmental concerns,
prompting the need for advanced systems that can monitor and mitigate pollution. This project
centers around the development of eco-friendly vehicle detection and carbon emission analysis
through the utilization of yolo (you only look once), a cutting-edge deep learning model designed
for real-time object detection. The system is created to categorize vehicles according to their fuel
type—electric, hybrid, or conventional—by examining visual characteristics and identifying
emission indicators. By combining image processing and deep learning techniques, the model
successfully identifies different types of vehicles and estimates their carbon emissions. The
gathered data can be utilized to evaluate pollution levels in urban regions, offering valuable
insights for sustainable transportation planning. The system's real-time monitoring features allow
for quick assessment, empowering government agencies and environmental organizations to
implement timely measures to support green mobility. This method helps minimize
environmental harm by enabling informed decision-making for cleaner transportation systems
through data analysis.
